# EconomyX
#### For Sponge economy servers

EconomyX provides a versatile backbone for any type of economy server.
As there is no built-in front end, a custom UI is required for it to be a functional product.
This can be a big time saver for server developers who want to focus on the front-end part of their server.

### Features
- Basically every asset type in existence ([asset](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Foasis%2Feconomyx%2Fasset))
- Multiple currencies supported
- Automated contract fulfillment
- Markets and auctions ([trading](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Foasis%2Feconomyx%2Ftrading))
- Options contracts dependent on market prices
- Employment and automated salary payment ([Employer.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Foasis%2Feconomyx%2Factor%2Ftypes%2FEmployer.java))

### Implementing EconomyX
- Forking this repository and adding in any code you desire is recommended.
- If you want to use this code from another plugin, add EconomyX as a dependency.
